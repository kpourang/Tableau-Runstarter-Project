<p>You have been approached by Runstarters – a crowdfunding platform based in the United States that has been operating since 2009. </p>

<p>They have their own internal Tableau employee, but due to their high workload they require some specific assistance in analyzing data of the projects on their platform. The assistance is primarily focused on implementing the appropriate filters, which will be used for further analysis and therefore we need to ensure that we implement the correct filter types for the appropriate analysis. </p>


<p>Below is a list of the requirements:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Database Administrator who provided the file indicated that there are some invalid records in the data. The invalid records can be identified where the Country field is equal “N.A.”) and should be excluded in the data source. </li>
    <li>We have further been informed that for this phase of the project we should only focus on the “Alpha” platform. To ensure that there is no confusion later when the model is taken over, this filter needs to be applied at the data source level. </li>
    <li>Build a basic stacked bar visualization showing the total amount pledged per country with a breakdown on Main Category, to be shown as percentage per country. Only include records relating to North America and Latam, while ensuring that all subsequent sheets that will be created, will be using this filtering automatically.</li>
    <li>Determine which Main Categories have projects with more than 20 000 backers per project. </li>
    <li>Determine which combinations of Main Category and Category collectively have more than 100 000 backers.</li>
    <li>Determine which Main Categories collectively have more than 100 000 backers.</li>
    <li>Create a dual axis Bar and Line chart to determine the relationship of number of Backers vs the average % of goal reached (pledged vs goal). An interactive Status filter needs to be available for the user, and the user should also be able to choose the number of projects with the highest number of backers shown. </li>
    <li>Create a timeline showing the number of projects launched. None of the previous filters should be applicable to this sheet. The timeline should automatically update to include only the projects for the last 4 years up to the current day that the model is being viewed. Also create interactive filters for the user where they can choose the Region, Country, Main Category and Category. Ensure to use the appropriate styles of filters are used and only show the relevant values based on the selection made.</li>
</ol>
